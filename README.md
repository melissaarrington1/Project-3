# Project-3

## About this App

This is a weather app that was build using the React MERN Stack. 

A user is able to create an account, select their favorite city, and view the current information for that city.

This app is also social as well! When logged in, you can see a list of all users that are currently using the weather app.

## User Stories

When a user arrives at the homepage, they are prompted to enter. They are then brought to a page where they can create a new account. 

When a user creates an account, they are brought to their personalized page, where they can see their information, update their account, and even delete their account.

When a user is creating their account, they can also see a list of all users that are currently using the weather app.

## Technologies Used: 
React
Express
MongoDB
Node.js
Material UI React
Axios

## Future Goals

A stretch goal is to be able to incorporate use of an API to pull in current weather data from any city in the world. I would also like to add the capability for a user to be able to add and save multiple cities.
